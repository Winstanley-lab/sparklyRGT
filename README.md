# sparklyRGT
Python RGT functions to tidy MEDPC data and plot desired variables 

Setup! 

Option 1: Online server 
- If you are a UBC student, you have access to JupyterHub and JupyterLab which are online spaces to use your code and Jupyter's interface
- This is by far the easiest option, as Git and all necessary packages are already downloaded
- Steps: 
    1. Open: https://ubc.syzygy.ca/ and login using your cwl 
    2. In the url, replace "tree" with "lab". For example, https://ubc.syzygy.ca/jupyter/user/dexrk/tree? --> https://ubc.syzygy.ca/jupyter/user/dexrk/lab?
    3. Clone the sparklyRGT repository (a collection of documents - https://github.com/deckyblue/sparklyRGT) by following section 5.6 (Cloning your repository...) of: https://ubc-dsci.github.io/introduction-to-datascience/version-control.html#cloning-your-repository-on-jupyterhub 
       
    

Option 2: Local software 
- If you'd like to perform your analysis on a local server, then follow section 12.1 to 12.3.3 (Jupyter Lab) of: 
- https://ubc-dsci.github.io/introduction-to-datascience/move-to-your-own-machine.html
    - Note! Don't download "miniconda", download "anaconda" instead (miniconda is a reduced version of anaconda and does not contain the required packages for sparklyRGT)
- From here, follow step 3 of option 1.
